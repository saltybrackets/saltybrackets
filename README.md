# Organizations

Repositories regularly get sorted into peronsal Github organizations for ease of searching.

Personal repositories kept directly under the **saltybrackets** profile are either very new (and so haven't been sorted yet), or are purely for personal research/education. Do not expect them to be regularly maintained, or even to stick around (as they'll either be moved, made private for archiving, or outright deleted).

## [SaltyCog: Tools / Mods / Hacks and Hacking](https://github.com/saltycog)
Repositories kept in the SaltyCog organization are generally intended for public consumption because they provide some utility, and most likely to be maintained/updated. These include things like non-game applications, game mods, and general libraries/frameworks.

## [Primitive Concept: Games and Gamejam Entries](https://github.com/primitiveconcept)
For archiving gamejam entries and game prototypes; unlikely to be maintained or updated. Full games I've worked on are either kept private, or belong to other entities.
